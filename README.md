# Cultural-Consensus-Theory-with-PyMC
midterm for Cogs107 - spring quarter

This project implements a Bayesian Cultural Consensus Theory (CCT) model using PyMC to analyze a dataset on plant knowledge from 10 informants across 20 binary questions. We model each informant's latent competence (`D`) as a Uniform(0.5, 1.0) prior and each consensus answer (`Z`) as a Bernoulli(0.5) prior. The model calculates the probability of each observed response using a weighted function of competence and consensus, and infers posterior distributions over both `D` and `Z`. Inference was performed using MCMC sampling with four chains, and all convergence diagnostics (e.g., r_hat) indicated reliable results.

The posterior estimates revealed a wide range of informant competence, with P6 being the most competent and P3 the least. The model predicted the consensus answer (`Z`) with high certainty in most cases. When compared to the naive majority vote for each question, the CCT model agreed on 19 of 20 items. The one disagreement (Q2) suggests that the model correctly weighted the more competent informants' answers, diverging from the flat majority. Posterior plots for both `D` and `Z` were generated and saved as `competence_plot.png` and `consensus_plot.png`. Overall, the CCT model provided a more principled and robust approach to inferring shared cultural knowledge than simple voting.
